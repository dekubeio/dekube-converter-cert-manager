cert-manager CRD converter for [dekube](https://dekube.io).

## Handled kinds

- `Certificate` -- generates real PEM certificates and injects them as synthetic K8s Secrets
- `ClusterIssuer` -- indexed for issuer resolution (no output)
- `Issuer` -- indexed for issuer resolution (no output)

## What it does

Replaces cert-manager's certificate issuance with local generation at conversion time. Produces real PEM files (CA chains, leaf certs) that workloads pick up through the existing Secret volume-mount machinery.

- Generates ECDSA or RSA private keys based on `spec.privateKey`
- Builds X.509 subjects from `spec.commonName` and `spec.subject`
- Adds SAN entries from `spec.dnsNames`
- Supports self-signed certificates (via `selfSigned` issuers) and CA-issued certificates (via `ca` issuers referencing a generated CA Secret)
- Processes certificates in rounds: self-signed CAs first, then CA-issued leaf certs, unlocking dependent chains
- Merges certificates that target the same `secretName` across namespaces (compose is flat -- same secretName = same file on disk, all SANs merged into one cert)
- Writes `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and `ca.crt` to `secrets/<secretName>/`
- Injects results into `ctx.secrets` as K8s Secret format (`stringData`), making them available to downstream extensions (trust-manager, keycloak) and workload volume mounts
- Certificates referencing ACME or missing issuers are skipped with a warning

## Priority

`100` -- runs early. Generates secrets consumed by trust-manager (priority 200) and keycloak (priority 500).

## Incompatibilities

- `flatten-internal-urls` — strips FQDNs from compose DNS, which breaks certificate SANs generated by this converter. dekube-manager blocks this combination by default. Override with `--ignore-compatibility-errors cert-manager` if you know what you're doing.

## Dependencies

- `cryptography` (listed in `requirements.txt`)

Install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Via dekube-manager (recommended):

```bash
python3 dekube-manager.py cert-manager
```

Manual:

```bash
python3 helmfile2compose.py --extensions-dir ./dekube-converter-cert-manager --helmfile-dir ~/my-platform -e local --output-dir .
```
